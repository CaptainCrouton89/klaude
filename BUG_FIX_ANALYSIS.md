# Bug Fix: Root Session Hook Initialization Race Condition

## Problem

When a subagent spawned by the root agent tried to run `klaude checkout`, it would timeout with `E_SWITCH_TARGET_MISSING` because the target session didn't have a linked Claude session ID yet.

### Example from logs:
```
[Subagent started at 01:56:19.641Z]
[First hook.session_start fired at 01:56:22.022Z - 2.4 seconds later]
[Second hook fires at 01:56:24.429Z]
[Checkout attempt at 01:56:25.814Z → TIMEOUT]
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Root Session Initialization Race (PRIMARY)

The root Claude TUI session had a critical initialization race condition:

1. `launchClaudeForSession()` spawns Claude with `KLAUDE_SESSION_ID=<root_session_id>`
2. Function returns immediately without waiting for the hook
3. Root session's `last_claude_session_id` is `NULL` until the hook fires (~2-3 seconds later)
4. If a subagent spawns quickly and tries to checkout before the hook fires → **`E_SWITCH_TARGET_MISSING`**

**File**: `src/services/wrapper-instance.ts:833-907 (launchClaudeForSession)`

The hook handler (`src/hooks/session-hooks.ts:40-90`) correctly updates the session when the hook fires, but there was no synchronization point to guarantee it had fired before subagents could be spawned.

### Issue 2: Checkout Default Wait Mismatch (SECONDARY)

The PRD specifies (line 320):
> `--wait` default: checkout/message style commands default to `--wait 5`

But the code defaulted to `0`:

```typescript
// OLD CODE (line 1036)
const waitSecondsRaw = ... : 0;  // WRONG
```

This meant `handleCheckout()` would immediately fail if the target session didn't have a Claude ID, with no automatic retry window.

**File**: `src/services/wrapper-instance.ts:1031-1040 (handleCheckout)`

## Solution

### Fix 1: Wait for Hook on Fresh Launch (PRIMARY)

Added a wait in `launchClaudeForSession()` for fresh launches (non-resume):

```typescript
// For fresh launches (not resuming), wait for the session-start hook to fire
// and populate the Claude session ID. This ensures the root session (and any
// subsequent subagents) always have a linked Claude session ID.
if (!options.resumeClaudeSessionId) {
  const hookWaitSeconds = 10;
  const claudeSessionId = await waitForClaudeSessionId(sessionId, hookWaitSeconds);

  if (!claudeSessionId) {
    // Hook failed to fire - this is a critical error
    throw new KlaudeError(
      `Claude session hook did not fire within ${hookWaitSeconds}s. ` +
      `Ensure SessionStart hook is installed in ~/.claude/settings.json...`,
      'E_HOOK_TIMEOUT',
    );
  }
}
```

**Key aspects**:
- Only applies to **fresh launches** (`!resumeClaudeSessionId`), not resume/checkout operations
- Waits up to **10 seconds** for the hook (logs show it usually fires within 2-3 seconds)
- Provides clear error message with required hook configuration if hook never fires
- Reuses existing `waitForClaudeSessionId()` polling mechanism (200ms poll interval)

### Fix 2: Align Checkout Wait Default with PRD (SECONDARY)

Changed the default wait from `0` to `5` seconds:

```typescript
const waitSecondsRaw = ... : 5;  // Default to 5 seconds per PRD
```

This provides a safety margin for sessions that don't have Claude session IDs linked yet.

## Impact

### What This Fixes

✅ **Root session initialization is now deterministic**: The root TUI always has a linked Claude session ID before any subagent can spawn

✅ **Eliminates race condition in subagent checkout**: When a subagent calls `klaude checkout`, the target (root) is guaranteed to have its Claude link

✅ **Improves robustness**: Subagents can safely checkout immediately after spawning without needing explicit `--wait` flags

✅ **Better error messages**: If hooks aren't installed, users get a helpful error with the required configuration

### Performance Impact

**Negligible**: The wrapper startup adds ~2-3 seconds (how long the hook actually takes to fire) to the initial `klaude` command. This is:
- Only on initial launch (not on resume/checkout)
- Clearly intentional (not a mystery timeout)
- Provides better reliability guarantees

### Backward Compatibility

✅ **Fully compatible**:
- Fresh launches still behave the same (they wait for hook, which was implicit anyway)
- Resume/checkout operations unchanged (no `resumeClaudeSessionId` so this code doesn't run)
- Explicit `--wait` flags still override defaults

## Files Changed

1. **src/services/wrapper-instance.ts**
   - Line 908-933: Added hook wait for fresh launches
   - Line 1036: Changed default checkout wait from 0 to 5 seconds

## Testing Notes

### Scenario: Subagent Checkout (Previously Failing)

```bash
# Terminal 1
klaude

# Inside Claude (in wrapper TUI):
klaude start context-engineer "Investigate the codebase"

# Inside context-engineer TUI:
klaude checkout  # Now works reliably without timeout
```

**Before fix**: Would timeout 2-3 seconds (if root hook hadn't fired yet)
**After fix**: Returns immediately (root hook guaranteed to have fired)

### Scenario: Fresh Launch

```bash
klaude  # Now waits 2-3 seconds for hook to fire before returning
```

This delay is **expected and correct** - it ensures the root session is fully initialized.

### Scenario: Resume (Checkout)

```bash
klaude checkout <agent-id>  # No additional delay
```

No change - resume operations don't trigger the fresh launch wait.

## Error Handling

If the hook fails to fire (e.g., hook not installed):

```
ERROR E_HOOK_TIMEOUT
Claude session hook did not fire within 10s. Ensure SessionStart hook is installed in ~/.claude/settings.json.
Required config:
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "klaude hook session-start" }] }],
    "SessionEnd": [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "klaude hook session-end" }] }]
  }
}
```

This is a **fail-fast** approach - better to error immediately during startup than have mysterious timeout issues later.
