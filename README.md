# klaude: A process wrapper for Claude Code with multi-agent session management

A wrapper that spawns Claude Code as a subprocess and manages multiple agent sessions with seamless context switching. Enables delegating work to specialized agents while maintaining stateful session history. Klaude now tracks Claude Code's native session identifiers so `--resume` always targets the correct conversation.

## Installation

### Global Install (Recommended)

```bash
npm install -g klaude
```

This installs `klaude` globally, making it available as a command from any directory.

**After installation, run the setup command:**

```bash
klaude setup-hooks
```

This installs git hooks into your `~/.claude/settings.json` that enable session management and context switching. This is required for multi-agent workflows to function properly.

During setup, you'll be prompted to install built-in agents. These example agents include:
- **programmer** – Complex multi-file implementations requiring pattern analysis
- **junior-engineer** – Focused implementation of well-specified tasks
- **context-engineer** – Codebase exploration and pattern discovery
- **senior-architect** – Technical review and architectural guidance

The built-in agents are optional and will be copied to `~/.claude/agents/` only if you confirm. They serve as examples you can customize or use as-is.

### Local Development

For development or local use in a project:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm link
```

Then run setup:

```bash
klaude setup-hooks
```

**Note for pnpm users:** `better-sqlite3` requires native compilation. If you get a "Could not locate the bindings file" error, you need to manually build it:

```bash
cd node_modules/.pnpm/better-sqlite3@*/node_modules/better-sqlite3
npm run build-release
```

Alternatively, configure pnpm to allow build scripts in `.npmrc`:
```
enable-pre-post-scripts=true
```

## Quick Start

### Starting Klaude from Terminal

```bash
cd your-project
klaude
```

This launches Claude Code inside a wrapper. Inside Claude, you can:

```bash
klaude start orchestrator "build auth system"
klaude sessions
enter-agent <agent-id>  # switch to another agent
```

### Using Klaude from Within Claude Code

Claude Code itself can invoke klaude to spawn specialized agents for delegated work. For example, in a Claude conversation, you can ask:

> "Use klaude to start a programmer agent to implement the authentication system."

This will spawn an agent in the background while you continue your conversation. You can:

- **Spawn agents**: `klaude start <agent-type> "<task description>"` — creates a new agent to work on a task
- **Check progress**: `klaude sessions` — view all active agents and their status
- **Switch agents**: `enter-agent <session-id>` or `klaude checkout <session-id>` — jump to another agent's session
- **Send messages**: `klaude message <session-id> "<instruction>"` — asynchronously direct an agent
- **Monitor logs**: `klaude logs <session-id>` — view what an agent is doing in real time

This enables powerful multi-agent workflows where Claude orchestrates specialized agents while maintaining context and coordinating their work.

Agent types are dynamically loaded from your agents directory (e.g., `~/.claude/agents/` or `./.claude/agents/`). Any agent definition available there can be used with `klaude start`.

The wrapper handles session switching seamlessly. When agents run, Klaude records both its internal session ID _and_ Claude Code's session ID; the latter is what the wrapper uses for `--resume`.

### Claude Binary Path

`~/.klaude/config.yaml` has setting `wrapper.claudeBinary`. The default points to `/opt/homebrew/bin/claude`.

## Architecture

**User runs `klaude` with no args** → Wrapper spawns Claude Code subprocess → User interacts with Claude normally, but can now spawn/manage agents

**Inside Claude**, commands like `klaude start`, `enter-agent`, etc. communicate with the wrapper. This wrapper is helpful because it can manage the TUI itself, force-interrupting it and then automatically starting a new TUI with a new agent spawned by claude code.

## State & Storage

~/.klaude/
  ├── sessions.db         # SQLite for session metadata + linked Claude session IDs
  ├── logs/
  │    ├── session-123.log
  │    ├── session-124.log
  ├── config.yaml

## Commands

All commands work from _within_ the Claude Code process (inside the wrapper). Many are meant to be run by Claude Code itself for multi-agent orchestration.

```
klaude <command> [options]
```

Commands:
  klaude
    Description: Starts the wrapper for that directory and creates a brand new TUI claude code agent as the root.

  klaude start <agent_type> <prompt> [agent_count] [options]
    Description: Spawns an agent (type loaded from agents directory) to perform the task. Agent prompt is appended with instructions on updating the parent. Runs detached by default.
    Agent Type: Name of any agent definition in your agents directory (e.g., `orchestrator`, `programmer`, `context-engineer`, or custom agents).
    Options:
      -c, --checkout       Checks out the agent immediately after starting
      -s, --share          Shares current context (last X messages) with the new agent
      -a, --attach         Attach to agent stream in foreground (blocks until completion)
      -v, --verbose        Show detailed debug information
      --instance <id>      Target specific wrapper instance
    Returns: The process and session ID of the started agent.

  klaude checkout [id]
    Description: Interrupts the current agent (cli), exits it, then enters the specified agent's session without interrupting the target agent. If no ID is provided, enters parent agent.
    Options:
      --timeout <seconds>  Wait for hooks to deliver target session id (default: 5)
      --instance <id>      Target specific wrapper instance

  enter-agent [id]
    Description: Alias for `klaude checkout` - switches to another agent session.

  klaude message <id> <prompt> [options]
    Description: Sends an asynchronous message to the specified agent.
    Options:
      --timeout <seconds>  Blocks until the agent responds (default: 5 seconds)
      --instance <id>      Target specific wrapper instance

  klaude interrupt <id>
    Description: Interrupts the specified agent's current operation.
    Options:
      --signal <signal>    Signal to send (default: SIGINT)
      --instance <id>      Target specific wrapper instance

  klaude sessions [options]
    Description: Views active klaude sessions, showing a brief description, first, and last message for each.
    Options:
      -v, --verbose        Displays more detailed information for each session

  klaude wait <sessionIds...> [options]
    Description: Block until agent session(s) complete
    Options:
      --timeout <seconds>  Maximum wait time (default: no limit)
      --any                Return when ANY complete (vs ALL)
      --interval <ms>      Poll interval (default: 500ms)

  klaude status <sessionIds...>
    Description: Check status of agent session(s)

  klaude logs <id> [options]
    Description: Read session logs
    Options:
      -f, --follow         Stream log continuously (like tail -f)
      -s, --summary        Summarize the session
      --raw                Show raw JSON events instead of filtered output
      -n, --lines <N>      Limit output to N lines (shows last N lines)
      --tail <N>           Show last N lines (alias for -n)
      --head <N>           Show first N lines
      --instance <id>      Target specific wrapper instance for live tailing
    Examples:
      klaude logs <id>              # View full log
      klaude logs <id> --tail 50    # Show last 50 lines
      klaude logs <id> -n 20        # Show last 20 lines
      klaude logs <id> --head 100   # Show first 100 lines
      klaude logs <id> -f           # Stream continuously

  klaude instances [options]
    Description: List all active wrapper instances for the current project.
    Options:
      --status             Query live status from active instances

  klaude setup-hooks
    Description: Install Klaude hooks to ~/.claude/settings.json for session management

Klaude is stateful—session data persists in SQLite after you exit. You can resume or inspect previous sessions later.

## MCP Server Configuration

Agents can be configured with specific MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers, giving them access to different tools and data sources. MCPs are configured across three scopes with precedence: **Local > Project > User**.

### MCP Scopes

Define available MCP servers at three levels:

**User Scope: `~/.klaude/.mcp.json`** (klaude global MCP registry, lowest priority):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sql": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres"],
      "env": {
        "DATABASE_URL": "postgresql://localhost/mydb"
      }
    },
    "json": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@anthropic-ai/mcp-json"]
    },
    "github": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/"
    }
  }
}
```

**Project Scope: `<project>/.mcp.json`** (shared via version control, medium priority):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "company-api": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "/usr/local/bin/company-mcp",
      "args": ["--config", "./mcp-config.json"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Local Scope: `<project>/.claude/settings.json`** (project-specific user settings, highest priority):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "personal-dev-server": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "/path/to/local/mcp-server"
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note**: Local scope MCPs are typically stored in `.claude/settings.json` which is usually gitignored, making them ideal for personal development servers, experimental configurations, or sensitive credentials specific to your machine.

### Per-Agent MCP Configuration

Agents can specify which MCPs they need in their frontmatter:

```markdown
name: Database Analyst
description: Analyzes SQL databases and JSON data
mcpServers: sql, json
inheritProjectMcps: false
inheritParentMcps: false
allowedAgents: junior-engineer

Agent instructions here...
```

**Frontmatter Fields:**
- `mcpServers`: Comma-separated list of MCP names from the registry (all three scopes)
- `inheritProjectMcps`: Inherit all MCPs from all scopes (default: true)
- `inheritParentMcps`: Inherit parent agent's MCPs (default: false)

**Resolution Logic:**
1. If `mcpServers` is specified → Use ONLY those MCPs (explicit override)
2. Otherwise:
   - If `inheritProjectMcps !== false` → Start with all available MCPs (local, project, and user scopes merged)
   - If `inheritParentMcps === true` → Add parent agent's resolved MCPs

**Examples:**

```markdown
# Agent with specific MCPs only
mcpServers: sql, json
inheritProjectMcps: false
```

```markdown
# Agent inheriting project defaults plus parent's MCPs
inheritProjectMcps: true
inheritParentMcps: true
```

```markdown
# Agent with project defaults but not parent's MCPs (default behavior)
inheritProjectMcps: true
inheritParentMcps: false
```
